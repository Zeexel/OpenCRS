## Forecast-Gen V2
The successor to the [original Forecast-Gen](https://github.com/Zeexel/forecast-gen), which is now heavily outdated as the U.S. National Weather Service has since done a ton of reworking to their API.

The goal of Forecast-Gen V2 is to update the stability, performance of the original project, as well as create something akin to the National Weather Service's [Console Replacement System (CRS)](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/automatevoice) whilst still being simple to set up, install, and run constantly on something such as a server running an internet radio stream.

The program is currently in early development, but releases can be found [here.](https://github.com/Zeexel/forecastgen-v2/releases)
